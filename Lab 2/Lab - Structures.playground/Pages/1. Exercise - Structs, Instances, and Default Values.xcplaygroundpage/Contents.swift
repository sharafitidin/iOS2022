 ## Exercise - Structs, Instances, and Default Values
 
 Imagine you are creating an app that will monitor location. Create a `GPS` struct with two variable properties, `latitude` and `longitude`, both with default values of 0.0.
 */
struct GPS{
    var latitude = 0.0
    var longtitude = 0.0

/*:
 Create a variable instance of `GPS` called `somePlace`. It should be initialized without supplying any arguments. Print out the latitude and longitude of `somePlace`, which should be 0.0 for both.
 */
var somePlace = GPS()
print(somePlace.latitude)
print(somePlace.longtitude)

/*:
 Change `somePlace`'s latitude to 51.514004, and the longitude to 0.125226, then print the updated values.
 */
somePlace.latitude = 51.514004
somePlace.longtitude = 0.125226gf

/*:
 Now imagine you are making a social app for sharing your favorite books. Create a `Book` struct with four variable properties: `title`, `author`, `pages`, and `price`. The default values for both `title` and `author` should be an empty string. `pages` should default to 0, and `price` should default to 0.0.

/*:
 Create a variable instance of `Book` called `favoriteBook` without supplying any arguments. Print out the title of `favoriteBook`. Does it currently reflect the title of your favorite book? Probably not. Change all four properties of `favoriteBook` to reflect your favorite book. Then, using the properties of `favoriteBook`, print out facts about the book.
